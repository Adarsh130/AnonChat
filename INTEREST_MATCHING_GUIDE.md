## 🧠 How Smart Matching Works

### Compatibility Score Calculation:

1. **Common Interests** = 10 points each
   - Example: Both like "Music" + "Gaming" = 20 points
   
2. **Same Mood** = 5 points
   - Example: Both feeling "Happy 😊" = 5 points

3. **Total Score Examples:**
   - 2 common interests + same mood = 25 points ⭐⭐⭐
   - 1 common interest + same mood = 15 points ⭐⭐
   - 1 common interest only = 10 points ⭐
   - No match = 0 points (fallback to random)

### Matching Priority:

```
Priority 1: Score ≥ 5 points (at least 1 interest or same mood)
Priority 2: Anyone waiting > 10 seconds (prevent long waits)
Priority 3: Add to queue and keep searching
```
